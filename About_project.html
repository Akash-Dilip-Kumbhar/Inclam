						<div class="content">
							<div class="about">
								<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>INCLAM </b> is a novel and a rich
									collection of various raagas of Indian Classical Music <i>(also known as Hindustani
										Classical Music).</i> <i style="color: yellow;"> A unique collection of vocal
										music where
										raagas are presented in their purest forms!</i>
								</p>

								<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>INCLAM </b> is presenting various raagas sung in
									<b>Indian Classical Music </b>using <i>Muktaswar</i> of that raaga. <i>(Word ‘Mukta’
										is used
										in Marathi, Hindi and
										many other Indian languages meaning
										‘Free’ / ‘liberated’ / ‘unbound’ and ‘swar’ means ‘musical notes’).</i> So,
									INCLAM
									happens to be Muktasangeet.<i style="color: yellow;">Liberated Indian Classical
										Music!</i>

							<h3> <u>INCLAM: <i>The Anibaddha Sangeet</i> … Enjoy the Boundless
									Music!</u></h3>
						</div>
						<div class="content">
							<div class="about">
								<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right from ancient times, various musical forms of Indian
									Classical
									Music were performed under
									two broad categories.<i style="color: yellow;"> The anibaddha (a-ni bud-dha) form,
										which
										is
										an open-form or free-form
										and the nibaddha (ni-bud-dha) sangeeta the closed or bound form.</i>
								</p>

								<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>Anibaddha sangeeta</i> (Boundless Music)</b> is the
									musical piece which is not restricted by and does not use any poetry or meaningful
									words
									and
									is also not bound by any <i>taala (rhythm)</i> in vocal
									recitals. Singer in this form is not under any obligation which comes with use of
									words
									and
									poetic lines or a rhythm and that avoids the repetitiveness that can come to the
									presentation of the raaga. Anibaddha music is thus not bound by words, taala or
									matra.

							<h3> <u>INCLAM: Breaking the Language barrier to enjoy Indian
									Classical Music</u> </h3>
						</div>
						<div class="content">
							<div class="about">
								<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Traditionally vocal Indian Classical Music uses various forms
									of
									poetry
									(bandish) either written or sung predominantly in multiple languages like
									Brajabhasha,
									Hindi, Awadhi, Punjabi, Bhojpuri and other Indian languages. The listener has to
									understand
									the meaning of the words in the poetry (and sometimes that becomes difficult) to
									enjoy
									what
									is being sung or may be altogether neglect the words and only imbibe the intonations
									of
									the
									sound of the music. Also, most of the poetries have repetitive themes related to
									gods,
									goddesses, spiritual discourses or describe the emotions of lovers, family relations
									etc.
									Interestingly, sometimes the exact meaning of the words is not important for the
									musical
									experience at all…!!!</p>

								<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since INCLAM does not use any words, the listener is empowered
									to
									not
									know the meaning of the words to understand the language of different compositions
									used
									in
									routine performances of Indian Classical Music. It thus makes an attempt to attract
									varied
									listeners to enjoy the Indian Classical Music. <i style="color: yellow;">INCLAM is a
										true universal music.</i></p>

						</div>
						<div class="content">
							<div class="about">
								<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It must be emphasized that traditionally in good old days
									vocalists
									did
									use to sing this form of music (that INCLAM presents) in their stage performances at
									the
									beginning of the raaga renditions that eventually would use <i>bandish</i> presented
									in
									a
									specific
									rhythm (<i>taala</i>). However, due to various factors this part/ style of
									presentation
									gradually
									grew short and the <i>typical Khyal and Bandish singing </i>(using poetry and
									rhythm)
									became
									the
									major part of presentation. </p>

								<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, there are plenty of anecdotes that the great exponents
									of
									<b>Indian Classical Music</b> have ultimately expressed that the real music lies
									purely
									in
									the
									vocal musical notes (swar) and rhythm is just an ‘external’ factor…The testimony to
									the
									originality and simplicity in expression of the mood, the musical notes intend to
									create.
									So, even the most ardent fans of Indian Classical Music will find a new way to enjoy
									pure
									vocal music in INCLAM.

									Any and every listener can easily “follow” or try to ‘sing along’ the piece of
									music!
									INCLAM
									artists have avoided the acrobatics and complicated styles sometimes adopted by the

									only to exhibit their intellectual proficiency. INCLAM is the simplified music for
									everyone!
									All the professional singers have put their soul in it and have succeeded in
									creating
									the
									moods that the raaga is supposed to be creating.</p>

								<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Expressing the emotions without the help of words and only with
									the
									musical notes is certainly a difficult task for the singers but all the artists have
									craftily made it seem simple and effortless. Therefore, listeners will certainly
									find it
									an
									enjoyable experience and who knows they might just be singing their own versions
									spontaneously! </p>

								<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All the talented singers who have contributed to INCLAM have

								<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;INCLAM is imaginative….singers have used their immense knowledge
									to
									compose the compositions of the raagas included in INCLAM which they have learnt
									from
									their
									well known teachers of Indian Classical Music and also the way they have practiced
									these
									raagas over the years and decades. </p>

								<p>For the students of Indian Classical Music, INCLAM provides a ready template for
									practicing
									these raagas. This will encourage them to compose their own compositions of the
									raagas
									and
									build their confidence for the stage performances.<i style="color: yellow;"> INCLAM

									on the singer to return to the <i> sama </i> (the first note of a cycle of rhythm)
									and
									therefore does
